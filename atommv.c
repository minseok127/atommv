/*
 * atommv.c - Atomic multi-version concurrency control library
 *
 * This file implements an mvcc mechanism for managing a pointer to a consistent
 * state along with reference counts. The design packs an outer reference count
 * and a version pointer into a single 64-bit control block stored in the
 * atommv_gate structure, while the version itself (atommv_version) maintains an
 * inner reference count.
 *
 * The 8-byte control block in atommv_gate is structured as follows:
 *   - Upper 16 bits: outer reference counter.
 *   - Lower 48 bits: index pointer of the current version.
 *
 * Writers have their own version and each version can be concurrently read by
 * multiple readers. If a writer simply deallocates an old version to
 * replace it, readers might access wrong memory. To avoid this, multiple
 * versions are maintained.
 * 
 * When a reader wants to access the current version, it atomically increments
 * the outer reference counter using fetch_add(). The returned 64-bit value has
 * its lower 48-bits representing the pointer of the version whose reference
 * count was increased. This allows the reader to obtain both the version
 * pointer and ensure that the reference counter is safely increased.
 *
 * After finishing the use of the version, the reader must release it. During release,
 * the reader increments the inner reference counter by 1. If the resulting inner
 * counter becomes 0, it indicates that no other threads are referencing that
 * version, so it can be freed.
 *
 * In the version replacement process, the writer atomically exchanges the 8-byte
 * control block with a new one (using atomic exchange), and the old control block,
 * which contains the previous outer reference count and version pointer, is
 * returned. Because this update is atomic, new readers cannot access the old
 * version anymore. The writer then decrements the old version's inner counter by the
 * outer reference count.
 *
 * Consequently, if a reader's release operation causes the inner counter to reach 0,
 * this reader is the last user of that version. If the writer's release operation
 * causes the inner counter to reach 0, this writer is the last user of that version.
 * Then the last user can free the old version.
